Curved rail a ( | )  (_: Swap)
-> Straight rail - 0 3
-> Curved rail a - 0 4 / 2 6
-> Curved rail b - 2 5
-> Half-diagonal rail - 2 5 (This and above can happen on the same dir. Prefer natural direction.)

Curved rail b ( / & \ )
-> Diagonal straight rail - 3 3
-> Half-diagonal rail - 2 4 / 4 2 (just check both i guess...)
